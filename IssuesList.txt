Cannot backup registry if there is absolutely no space left on the PC

REG QUERY errors:
ERROR: The System was unable to find the specified registry key or value.

Ideas:
Make it rename the users folder first, then delete the registry keys, then delete the renamed user folder.
This will ensure the user has no trouble logging in if something goes wrong or if the program is ended while a deletion is running.
